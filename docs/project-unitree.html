          <p>
            This team challenge was run by Prodigi (formerly called DigiHub) for
            their Product Design Program in 2021 as a way to help students learn
            about and gain experience with product design. Students were
            arranged into teams of four, as well as assigned a member of Prodigi
            to act as a supervisor throughout the program and a mentor who was a
            working professional in the field. Our team was lucky to have a
            mentor who was working as a product designer at Canva at the time.
            Weekly student-led workshops on different aspects of the product
            design process would be run every week until the end of the program.

            <h3>Userbase Survey Results</h3>
            <p>
              Our team compiled a survey of questions to share with UNSW staff
              and students. This helped us form an understanding of what the
              average user may want out of the playform, and of any existing
              shortcomings we could tackle. The survey received 100+ responses
              from UNSW students and staff. From these responses, we identified
              the main issues with the existing platform to be:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Unused Features</li>
              <li>Difficult Navigation</li>
              <li>Poor Aesthetics</li>
            </ul>

              <div class="col-md">
                <h4>Popular Features</h4>
                <p>
                  Over 97% of the responses considered the following to be the
                  must used functions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Accessing Lectures/Tutorials</li>
                  <li>Accessing Online Assessments</li>
                  <li>Submitting Homework/Assignments</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Moodle has other existing features but many were left unused
                  by both staff and students.

                <p>
                  The respondents gave a rating of 3.5/5 average for the ease of
                  locating the information or links that they want or need on
                  the platform.

                <h4>Aesthetics</h4>
                <p>
                  Of the responses, 82% considered aesthetics of the user
                  interface to be an important factor to the usability of a
                  learning platform.

                  Participants were also asked to provide any additional
                  feedback. Some of these helped inspire us to create new
                  features such as a customisable sidebar, a calendar spread for
                  classes and assessments, and an improved results page for
                  grades.

            <p>
              From the survey results, we created user personas to cover what
              common users may be. These were decided based on the most defining
              characteristics that impact how a user interacts with the
              platform. Below are two examples:

                      David wants a centralised schedule that shows him any

              Students like David already lack the incentive to visit Moodle
              regularly. UniTree strived to redesign the platform to better
              facilitate effective learning, encouraging students to learn their
              own way whilst also transforming the way that staff can manage
              their workload.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the user goals had been identified in the personas, these
              were expanded upon to create a list of requirements that our
              design intended to fulfill.

            <p>
              User tests were created and hosted on Maze based on our low-mid
              fidelity Figma mockups. Volunteers were asked to complete a series
              of tasks and Maze would collect details such as misclick rates,
              duration, average surccess rates, and percentage of users who gave
              up on a task. Test users included students, staff, and non-UNSW
              students who were unfamiliar with the original platform interface.

              <h4>Sidebar</h4>
              <p>
                Students like David are able to optimise their learning in their
                own way, with the newly refined sidebar feature. Having our
                sidebar reduces visual clutter, ultimately creating better
                navigation and reducing the amount of time to navigate across
                Moodle.
              </p>
              <p>
                The customisable features of the sidebar also allow users to
                have easy access to their most viewed pages, as well as pin any
                important bookmarks. The freedom to make the sidebar their own
                allows a return to what is convenient and personalised for each
                user. This creates more motivation to choose Moodle as a primary
                platform for managing university work.
              </p>
              <p>
                The sidebar is available on all pages, which improves efficiency
                and reduces navigation difficulties for the user.

              <h4>Calendar</h4>
              <p>
                The new addition of a larger and more interactive calendar will
                allow users to optimise thier schedules and assessment
                timelines, all in one place. We aim to help students like David
                and his frustrations with assessments by showing deadlines on
                the calendar with additional shortcuts to submission links as
                well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our calendar will be synced to class timetables, which will
                predominately be from myUNSW, giving direct access to course
                pages and classes. Users can also link external calendars to the
                calendar timetable display, providing users the ability to also
                view their other comminments throughout the week, and plan out
                their days accordingly.

              <p>
                Currently viewing or submitting results can involve going to
                multiple different websites, especially in subjects from
                different faculties. Sites like Moodle, myUNSW, UNSW Review, or
                WebCMS are some examples of places students go to get results
                and feedback. This means that there is not only an issue of
                different websites for different classes, but also different
                websites for assessments vs final results.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our version of the Results page displays assessment results and
                overall results. A chart on the right provides a visual
                representation of the student's progress for a course.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students can view results for a course by using the year studied
                and the course code. The assessment title can be clicked on to
                view any submission details and also for any marker's feedback
                from staff members. Being able to access this feedback is
                important for a student's ability to identify areas for
                improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Staff also benefit from being able to mark and post results on
                the same platform that they receive the student submissions
                from, which simplifies the whole marking process.

              </p>
              <p>
                A few additional tasks were also included, which were chosen to
                test if users could intuitively understand what elements to look
                for and click on our interface. The user would have to interact
                with each of our main three features at least once during the
                test.

              <p>
                Our high fidelity user tests on Maze produced some insightful
                results. In addition to the tasks, users were also asked at the
                end of the test to give a rating our of 5 based on their
                experience. The downside to these remote, self-guided online
                user tests are that there is a missed opportunity to make
                behavioural observations or for the user to ask a facilitator
                questions during the test. We also included a final feedback
                question to gvie our test users the chance to express their
                opinions to us directly.
              </p>

              <p>
                Nearly 3/4 of our users found navigating the UI to be a seamless
                experience, with an average experience rating of 4.7 out of 5.
              </p>
              <p>
                With increased intuition rates for our calendar and grafe
                features, we have found a 34% increase in UX satisfaction
                compared to our survey results for the original Moodle platform
                interface. Our UI was praised for being clean and easy to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other common notes from feedback include users appreciating that
                courses in the calendar timetable were colour-coded, and that
                users liked the fact that the results page was easily accessible
                at all times from the sidebar, especially compared to the
                pre-existing location of the results and grades page.

          <p>
            I found this program to be a valuable follow-up experience to the
            <a>PantryPal</a> project I had done the year before for my
            Human-Computer Interaction class. Much of the weekly workshop
            content reinforced the practices and methods I had learn in that
            class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each team had to build a presentation around their case study and
            present it to all the other teams, the Prodigi mentors, and a panel
            of select judges who were all people who had been working in product
            design. We had rehearsed a number of times beforehand, in order to
            minimise mishaps happening, especially considering this was all done
            remotely on a massive Zoom call.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a professional as our team member was a highlight of this
            program experience. Unlike a talk or panel hosted by a society or
            organisation, the mentorship allowed us to be able to directly ask
            questions about her experience and the product design field. More
            than that, our mentor was able to explain to us processes and
            approaches that she had used in real life, and be able to relate it
            to our project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoyed the program a lot and had quickly signed up for their
            follow-up program, the Client Design Program, which would give us

            about that experience <a href="./project-freeguides.html">here</a>.
