          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>This project was a group assignment for a Human-Computer Interaction course I took in 2020. I was part of a team of 5 classmates. Due to social distancing restrictions, this project was collaborated on remotely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md">
          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>Design with the theme 'Home Automation'. With more people spending mpre and more hours at home, people are looking for ways to enhance thier living experience. Students must design a solution that will be useful for families.</p>

      <!-- User Research Section -->
      <h2 class="text-center">USER RESEARCH</h2>

      <!-- Online Questionnaire -->
      <h2>Online Questionnaire</h2>
      <p>Once we had settled on the idea of a kitchen management system, we created an online survey in order to gain perspective from people in other demographics. We tried to have at least one respondant from each age range, from teens to working adults in their 50s.</p>
      <p>An important takeaway from our survey results was that people had felt that having reminders were essential to having a good experience with a management system. This was especially the case with reminders for things like expiry dates and shopping lists.</p>
      <img src="../assets/pantrypal/survey-results-1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
      <p>The most popular app feature ideas were translated into specific requirements for the app's prototypes.</p>

          <div class="col-sm">
            <h2>User Personas</h2>
            <p>We made three user personas as well as context scenarios for each persona. Our personas attempted to cover people from different age ranges, and living circumstances who were involved in their grocery shopping and home kitchens in different ways e.g., parents, adults living alone, or children without their own money.</p>
            <p>All these personas, for a variety of reasons, wanted to maximise the efficiency of their household's shopping.</p>

      <!-- Requirements -->
      <div>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>Before we started any sketches, we created and revised a list of functional and non-functional requirements. It was to ensure that all team members were on the same page as to what was expected of our sketches.</p>
        <p>This mostly applied to the functional requirements, which listed features and their respective properties that should exist in our app. Non-functional requirements mostly weren't going to be implemented in our prototypes, but it was good practice for us to write them out anyway for a hypothetical development team to use a guideline for building an actual app.</p>

      <!-- Low Fidelity Wireframes -->
      <h2>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <p>Since we were completing this project entirely remotely, we chose to use Balsamiq to create our first wrieframes. We wanted our app to work for mobile and tablet devices primarily. We ended up choosing tablet dimensions for the prototype demonstrations in order to visualise what the app could possibly look like on a smart refridgerator.</p>

      <!-- User Testing -->
      <div>
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>Using Balsamiq and Figma meant that we could add interactions via click to our wireframes. This was useful when it came to testing our PantryPal app interface.</p>
        <p>Participants of our user tests were provided a link to the Balsamiq or Figma file. They could click and move around at their own pace, and thier screen would be shared with the the team. A member of our team would act as the facilitator, and introduce the user to the test process and receive formal consent for participation. The rest of the team acted mostly as observers and note-takers throughout the duration of the user tests.</p>
        <p>The user test participants were asked to use the 'Think Aloud' technique, in which they were encouraged to narrate their actions and thoughts as they moved through the user test tasks. The observers on the team would note down the clicks, timings, and any verbal feedback provided by the participant.</p>
        <p>A Usability Test Plan was drafted to ensure that the process remained as consistent and close as possible for all our participants. They would have four tasks to attempt to complete using the app wireframes. We would later tidy up and share our notes, so that we could then analyse and evaluate the data based on both performance and behavioural measures. We would then use this to create an issues table that would then inform any following changes we would make to our next iteration of prototypes.</p>
        
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm">
            <p>For example, our low fidelity wireframe sketches had included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a map feature to locate nearby stores and supermarkets and compare prices of popular items available in their catalogues</li>
              <li>a meal planning feature to go with our recipe and calendar ideas</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But both those features were later left out of our high fidelity prototypes because our user test results showed that the test participants almost never considered it necessary to click on or use them. Thus these features were considered low priority and left out of our following iterations of prototypes.</p>
