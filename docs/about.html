    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I am currently an undergraduate student studying a double degree in Computer Science and Media Arts at the University of New South Wales. </p>
    <p>In 2020, I participated in UNSW Digital Society as a Digital Director. DigiSoc aims to help fellow students learn skills and build connections for careers in areas like digital strategy or UI/UX and product design. In this role, I co-led a team of designers to make content for the society. This included social media graphics for events, infographics and videos for educational content , and even putting together a yearbook at the end of the year to commemorate the society's first year. </p>
