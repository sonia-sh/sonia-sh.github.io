                    <p>I am currently an undergraduate student studying a double degree in Computer Science and Media Arts at the University of New South Wales. </p>
                    <p>In 2020, I participated in UNSW Digital Society as a Digital Director. DigiSoc aims to help fellow students learn skills and build connections for careers in areas like digital strategy or UI/UX and product design. In this role, I co-led a team of designers to make content for the society. This included social media graphics for events, infographics and videos for educational content , and even putting together a yearbook at the end of the year to commemorate the society's first year. </p>

                    <p>I mid-2020, I joined UNSW Illuminate as a member of the art & design subcommittee. In this role, we were responsible for artistic designs and renders, as well as conceptual statements for ongoing projects. Such projects included: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A submission for 2021 Vivid Sydney. My part included participating in developing the concepts, contributing to sketches and renders, and writing in the conceptual statement and submission.</li>
                        <li>We are currently planning a workshop to teach other students how to use Adobe Illustrator, and consequently be able to laser cut custom designs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I am aiming to graduate by mid-2022.</p>

                <br>
                <p>My time participating in student clubs has given me extra experience when it comes to collaborating with new people from different areas of study.</p>
                <p>As a sub-committee member, it was important to develop my teamwork skills and be able to complete my assigned tasks on time.</p>
                <p>As a director, I had to learn to coordinate, organise, and lead team meetings or tasks. Not only did I have to ensure that I did my own work well, I also had to delegate and check up on other team members to make sure that everything was going smoothly. Before this, I rarely spoke up during meetings, but since then I have become familiar with creating a meeting agenda, taking minutes, and trying to give everyone a chance to speak during a meeting.</p>
                <p>My planning and organisation skills have also improved from my experience co-leading a team. Having people count on me to do my part motivated me to be more prepared.</p>
